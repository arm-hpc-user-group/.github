#Arm HPC User Group Github Organization

The Arm HPC User Group â€“ or AHUG, is a user-led, not-for-profit organization intent on promoting the latest Arm-based silicon, systems and platforms for the High Performance and Technical Computing community. The organization is open to all members, and our focus is on supporting community engagement and education via workshops, tutorials, and hackathons.
