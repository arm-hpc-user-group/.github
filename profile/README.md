# Arm HPC User Group

The Arm HPC User Group (AHUG) is a user-led not-for-profit organization intent on promoting the latest Arm-based silicon, systems and platforms for the High Performance and Technical Computing community. The organization is open to all members, and our focus is on supporting community engagement and education via workshops, tutorials, and hackathons.
